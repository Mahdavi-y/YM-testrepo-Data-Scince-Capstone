In this project which I have done as my IMB Data Science certificate capstone, I predicted wether the first stage of the SpaceX Falcon 9 landing would be successful or not. 

## Executive Summary
### Summary of methodologies
  SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore, if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch.
### Summary of all results
Successful landings occurred for Payload Masses under 8000 kg. More precisely, more successful landings occurred for Payload Masses under 7000 kg at GTO and ISS launch sites.
Four orbits of ES-L1, GEO, HEO, and SSO acquired the highest success rate among other orbits.

- The success rate kept increasing from 2013 until 2020; however, it had a slight drop in 2018.
- The total payload mass launched by NASA was 107010 kg.
- The first successful landing outcome on the ground pad occurred on the 4th of June 2010.
- All predicting models had high accuracy, however, the Decisions Tree model gained the highest
accuracy of % 94 among other models.
